# Project Definition

## Project Overview
Fake news detection is a crucial tool in today's information society, where the spread of misinformation has increased [[1]](#ref1). In an era where social media and online platforms serve as primary news sources, distinguishing between truthful and false information is more important than ever. Fake news can distort public awareness, undermine trust in institutions and even interfere with democratic decision-making.

The impact of fake news is far-reaching: it can influence elections, deepen social divisions and even lead to violent conflict. In light of these challenges, the ability to effectively recognize and combat fake news is becoming an indispensable part of media literacy. Automated fake news detection technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing, play a key role by making it possible to analyze large amounts of data and quickly identify potential disinformation.

## Problem Statement
The aim is to use the WELFake dataset [[2]](#ref2) to make a prediction as to whether an article is real or fake information. Machine learning algorithms and natural language processing will be used for this purpose. 

To increase the accuracy of the model, additional input parameters are developed using feature engineering. Suitable input variables (features) are generated from the raw data (articles). Sometimes important information is not directly visible in the raw data. Feature engineering can help to extract this information.
