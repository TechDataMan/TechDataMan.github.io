# Project Definition

## Project Overview
Fake news detection is a crucial tool in today's information society, where the spread of misinformation has increased [[1]](#ref1). In an era where social media and online platforms serve as primary news sources, distinguishing between truthful and false information is more important than ever. Fake news can distort public awareness, undermine trust in institutions and even interfere with democratic decision-making.

The impact of fake news is far-reaching: it can influence elections, deepen social divisions and even lead to violent conflict. In light of these challenges, the ability to effectively recognize and combat fake news is becoming an indispensable part of media literacy. Automated fake news detection technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing, play a key role by making it possible to analyze large amounts of data and quickly identify potential disinformation.

The aim is to use the WELFake dataset [[2]](#ref2) to make a prediction about whether an article is real or fake information. The WELFake dataset was compiled for the development of algorithms for detecting fake news. This dataset contains 72k news articles with 35k real and 37k fake news. The dataset contains four columns: serial number (starting at 0); title (headline of the text message); text (content of the message); and label (0 = real and 1 = fake).

## Problem Statement
The problem to be solved is to predict the truthfulness of the available information. Machine learning and natural language processing algorithms are used for this. The goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy. To increase the accuracy of the model, additional input parameters are developed using feature engineering. Suitable input variables (features) are generated from the raw data (articles). Sometimes important information is not directly visible in the raw data. Feature engineering can be used to extract this information. The generated dataset is then classified using various algorithms. An attempt is then made to further increase the accuracy using parameter optimization.
