## Introduction

Becoming rich as a data scientist certainly depends on various key factors. The country certainly plays a decisive role. Industrialized nations tend to offer higher salaries and more career opportunities in this field. Companies in these countries are investing heavily in data analysis and artificial intelligence, which means that the demand for well-trained data scientists is constantly growing. But which countries are these?

It is safe to assume that a solid education is essential to succeed in this competitive market. But do you have to be a highly educated university graduate or is it better to train as an IT specialist or even enter the field from the side?

In addition to formal training, knowledge of certain programming languages is of great importance. Programming languages make it possible to analyze complex data, develop models and gain valuable insights that are of great benefit to companies. Which programming languages should I learn?

These questions need to be answered using the [2024 StackOverflow's user survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024). 




Fake news detection is a crucial tool in today's information society, where the spread of misinformation has increased exponentially. In an era where social media and online platforms serve as primary news sources, distinguishing between truthful and false information is more important than ever. Fake news can distort public awareness, undermine trust in institutions and even interfere with democratic decision-making.

The impact of fake news is far-reaching: it can influence elections, deepen social divisions and even lead to violent conflict. In light of these challenges, the ability to effectively recognize and combat fake news is becoming an indispensable part of media literacy. Automated fake news detection technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing, play a key role by making it possible to analyze large amounts of data and quickly identify potential disinformation.
