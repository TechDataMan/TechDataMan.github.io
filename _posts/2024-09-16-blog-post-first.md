## Introduction

Becoming rich as a data scientist certainly depends on various key factors. The country certainly plays a decisive role. Industrialized nations tend to offer higher salaries and more career opportunities in this field. Companies in these countries are investing heavily in data analysis and artificial intelligence, which means that the demand for well-trained data scientists is constantly growing. But which countries are these?

It is safe to assume that a solid education is essential to succeed in this competitive market. But do you have to be a highly educated university graduate or is it better to train as an IT specialist or even enter the field from the side?

In addition to formal training, knowledge of certain programming languages is of great importance. Programming languages make it possible to analyze complex data, develop models and gain valuable insights that are of great benefit to companies. Which programming languages should I learn?

These questions need to be answered using [StackOverflow's annual user survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024).

## Conclusion
You won't get rich as a data scientist - but you can definitely earn a good salary by combining a favorable location, solid training and mastery of essential programming languages. With these prerequisites, you can position yourself in an exciting and future-oriented professional field that offers not only financial returns, but also professional fulfillment.

Many data scientists are highly educated. The usual educational path often begins with a bachelor's degree in computer science, mathematics, statistics or a related field. Many supplement their education with a master's degree or even a doctorate to deepen their expertise and improve their career opportunities. Learn the most important tools of a data scientist - the programming languages Python and SQL - and go out into the world for a high salary. Interesting countries include the USA, Singapore, Israel and Switzerland.
