## Introduction

Becoming rich as a data scientist certainly depends on various key factors. The country certainly plays a decisive role. Industrialized nations tend to offer higher salaries and more career opportunities in this field. Companies in these countries are investing heavily in data analysis and artificial intelligence, which means that the demand for well-trained data scientists is constantly growing. But which countries are these?

It is safe to assume that a solid education is essential to succeed in this competitive market. But do you have to be a highly educated university graduate or is it better to train as an IT specialist or even enter the field from the side?

In addition to formal training, knowledge of certain programming languages is of great importance. Programming languages make it possible to analyze complex data, develop models and gain valuable insights that are of great benefit to companies. Which programming languages should I learn?

These questions need to be answered using the [2024 StackOverflow's user survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024). 

### What education should I have?
To answer the first question, let's look at Figure 1. The data shows that the income of a data scientist worldwide is largely dependent on education. A university degree in relevant fields such as computer science, statistics or data science lays the foundation for a high income potential. Universities impart indispensable skills and knowledge that are highly valued on the job market. A strong academic foundation forms the basis for understanding complex algorithms and models used in data analysis.

In addition, further education and the acquisition of certificates, such as in machine learning or big data technologies, are crucial to be successful in the job market. Educational qualifications and specific skills also help to stand out from the competition and secure challenging positions in leading companies worldwide.

### Where do I have to go?
If you look at the analysis (Figure 2), you can see that data scientists play a decisive role, especially in industrialized countries such as USA or Switzerland. The main reason for this is the enormous amount of data that is generated every day. Companies in these regions have realized that analyzing data provides valuable insights that can support strategic decisions and improve business results. The complexity of data analysis requires specialized skills that data scientists possess. In developed countries, competition among companies is intense and the ability to use data effectively offers a decisive advantage. Data scientists help to optimize processes, reduce costs and identify new business opportunities.

Judging by the analysis, South Africa also appears to be emerging as a major player in data science. The increasing demand for qualified data scientists and the presumably limited supply of skilled workers is presumably leading to these high salaries in these regions.

### Which programming language should I learn?
As can be seen from the analysis (Figure 3), a large number of well-paid and highly trained programmers are proficient in languages such as Python, SQL and HTML. These programming languages are of central importance, as they are the only ones that enable a wide range of tasks and analyses. 

- Python is particularly popular due to its simplicity and the wide range of libraries available, such as Pandas, NumPy and SciPy, which facilitate data handling and analysis. 
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for accessing, editing and managing large databases as it enables efficient and complex data queries.
- JAVA offers robust and scalable programming, which is important for the development of real-time systems and sophisticated algorithms. 
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is critical for displaying and reporting data in web-based dashboards and reporting interfaces.

The interplay of these languages enables data scientists to create complex data pipelines, analyze data and effectively visualize and communicate the results. The high salaries in these regions are presumably the result of the high demand for skilled workers.

## Conclusion
You won't get rich as a data scientist - but you can definitely earn a good salary by combining a favorable location, solid training and mastery of essential programming languages. With these prerequisites, you can position yourself in an exciting and future-oriented professional field that offers not only financial returns, but also professional fulfillment.

Many data scientists are highly educated. The usual educational path often begins with a bachelor's degree in computer science, mathematics, statistics or a related field. Many supplement their education with a master's degree or even a doctorate to deepen their expertise and improve their career opportunities. Learn the most important tools of a Data Scientist - the programming languages Python and SQL - and go out into the world for a high salary. Interesting countries for Data Scientists are South Africa, USA, Singapore, Israel and Switzerland.
